Please create a new self-contained edit instruction to reverse the previously applied changes on specific objects. Please output Old Chain of Events, New Chain of Events, a self-contained explanation, and Edit Instruction. Avoid implying prior existence of elements (e.g., say 'Add some cars to the background' instead of 'Add the cars'). Avoid using words or phrases like "previously," "added before," "returned," "earlier," "original,", or "once again". Do not add or omit any details.Â 

If the original attribute is not mentioned (e.g., "Change the microphone changed to blue," with the original color not mentioned), the reversed caption must preserve this ambiguity. In such cases, the new instruction should describe the change generically (e.g., "Change the blue microphone color").

Example Input:
Edit Instruction: Change the wood building material to red brick.

Example Output:
Self-Contained Explanation: The building material of the structure was modified to red brick to achieve a different aesthetic and enhance durability. In the reversed scenario, the red brick material is switched to wood, thereby altering the building's appearance. The new self-contained instruction avoids any references to prior states, conditions or sequences, and steering clear of phrases like "previously," "added before," "currently," "returned," "earlier," "original," or "once again."

New Chain of Events: red brick -> change -> wood building material
